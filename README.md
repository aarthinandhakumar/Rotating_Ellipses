# Rotating Ellipses Application

This is a simple HTML5 SVG application in which 4 ellipses, one in each quadrant, rotate about their axes in a visually appealing manner. The rotation is either fast or slow depending upon the Duration slider, with a default value set to 5.

## Features

- **SVG Size**: 500 x 500
- **Pattern**: 4 ellipses rotate about their axes
- **Control**: A slider to adjust the duration (range: 1-10, step: 1)

## How to Use

1. Open `part2.html` in a browser.
2. The ellipses rotate about their axes in a fixed position in such a way that it forms a visually aesthetic effect.
3. Use the slider to change the duration between 1 and 10.
4. The rotation slows down if the duration is more and increases if the duration is less.
   
## File Structure

- **part2.html**: The HTML file containing the svg code and slider options.
- **part2.js**: The JavaScript file that aids in the speed of the rotation of the ellipses
   
## Installation

1. Download or clone the project to your local machine.
2. Open `part2.html` in any modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
3. No additional dependencies are required.

## Example Output

Once the application file is launched, all 4 ellipses rotate about their axes with a speed of 5. The rotation speed increases if the duration is less and reduces if the duration is more.
